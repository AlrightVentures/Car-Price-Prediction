# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project I predict a car's market price using its attributes.

The data set I work with contains information on various cars. For each car I have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
